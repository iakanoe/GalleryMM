This is my interpretation of MediaMonks' Android coding challenge. It was developed in the span of two evenings and part of an afternoon. I wanted to
make cooler layouts but the mock API is not prepared for what I wanted (I wanted to get only the first picture of each album to show as thumbnails)
and also I realised the pictures were not cool to look at anyway. I thought there would be scenic views or something! :/
